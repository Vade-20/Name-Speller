# Number Speller

A simple GUI application built using Tkinter that converts a numerical input into its corresponding word representation. For example, it converts "123" into "One Hundred Twenty Three".

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This code is written in Python 3.

## Usage

1. Enter a positive natural number without commas or underscores in the input field.
2. Press the "Enter" button or press "Enter" key to convert the number.
3. The word representation of the number will be displayed in the text area below.
4. You can press the "Reset" button to clear the input field and the text area.
5. The "Backspace" button can be used to delete the last digit from the input field.

## Limitations
1. The code supports numbers up to 999 Quintillion (999,999,999,999,999,999,999).
2. Special characters or non-numeric inputs will result in an error message.
